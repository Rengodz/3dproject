    <p>"Hello, my name is Anis and I'm a web developer based in Paris, France. I began my coding journey by studying Node.js and React at OCR (openclassroom), 
        an online school that provides resources and a platform for students to work on projects independently. You can find some of my projects on my <a href="https://github.com/Rengodz">Github</a> page</p>

        <p>In addition to programming, I have a passion for graphic design and enjoy exploring various forms of art and filmmaking in my free time. If you're interested, you can check out some of my work on my <a href="https://www.instagram.com/sinemezia/">Instagram</a> account.
        
        When I'm not coding or creating art, I love immersing myself in the worlds of cinema and video games. If you're not a fan of these topics, don't worry - I promise not to talk your ear off! </p>
        
        <p>If you have a project in mind, please don't hesitate to contact me. I'd love to discuss it over a cup of coffee. Thanks for visiting my portfolio website and I look forward to hearing from you!"</p>
